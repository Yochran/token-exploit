# token-exploit
A discord token exploiter that allows for remote access to someone's discord account.

# <!> DISCLAIMER <!>
This is not a magic program. This program is meant specifically for me to test the discord API for exploits. If you want remote access to someone's discord account, you need to rat them and get their token from their PC. And if you're going to go through the trouble of doing that, then you shouldn't be using this utility anyway.

# About
I was doing some research on the discord API for my bot development when I realized that the discord API for bot calls and user calls are the exact same.<br />
This means if you have someone's token, you can send messages from their account, get their chat history, get their friends list, and even get their payment information (via discord nitro).
